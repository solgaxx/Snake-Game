# SNAKE-GAME: JAKE THE SNAKE
🐍 Welcome to the Jake the Snake Game repository!

🐍 This game was a class project at UD in Introduction to Python.

Here, you'll find an exciting and classic game written in Python that invites you to immerse yourself in the world of the slippery snake named Jake. Your mission? To guide Jake around a bordered plane, gobbling up watermelon and avoiding both the treacherous edges of the playing area and Jake's own elongating tail. As you steer the snake's head in different directions—up, down, left, or right—Jake's body follows, weaving a trail of his journey across the playing field.
