# SNAKE-GAME: JAKE THE SNAKE
üêç Welcome to the Jake the Snake Game repository!

üêç This game was a class project at UD in Introduction to Python.

Here, you'll find an exciting and classic game written in Python that invites you to immerse yourself in the world of the slippery snake named Jake. Your mission? To guide Jake around a bordered plane, gobbling up watermelon and avoiding both the treacherous edges of the playing area and Jake's own elongating tail. As you steer the snake's head in different directions‚Äîup, down, left, or right‚ÄîJake's body follows, weaving a trail of his journey across the playing field.

# KEY FEATURES

# Tail Growth Mechanic:
Each time Jake devours a delectable watermelon, his tail grows longer. This ingenious twist keeps the game engaging, challenging you to navigate through an increasingly convoluted path without colliding with yourself.

# Intuitive Controls:
Maneuvering Jake is a breeze thanks to intuitive controls. The arrow keys allow you to dictate the direction of Jake's movement.

# Score Tracking:
The game keeps track of the number of watermelon pieces that Jake consumes. Your goal is to achieve the highest possible score while mastering the art of evading obstacles and tail entanglement.
